# My PhD research
My name is Eric Ju-Wei Cheng, a Ph.D in the Institute of Electrical and Control Engineering from National Chiao Tung University.<br> 
My research focused mostly on the field of deep learning.<br>
I also am familiar with subjects such as computer vision, image processing, pattern recognition, and embedded system, etc.<br>

### Driving fatigue prediction using EEG image

In my dissertation, an image-based approach for human brain signal analysis is proposed.
The brain signals is transformed into a 2D color image, and then passed into a Concolutional Neural Network(CNN) model for clasiification.
There are two advantages in our proposed system: (1) The spatial information of the human brain signal can be well preserved via the transformed 2D color images, (2) the proposed algorithm is a fully automatic system without any manual artifact removal process.


The detailed information is available in the following paper:<br>
